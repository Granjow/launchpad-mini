JavaScript library for interacting with the Novation Launchpad MINI.

Other node.js libraries exist, which you may want to consider as well, like:

* [launchpadder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/launchpadder)
* [midi-launchpad](https://www.npmjs.com/package/midi-launchpad)
* [phi-launchpad](https://www.npmjs.com/package/phi-launchpad)

I am writing this yet-another-lauchpad-library because:

* phi-launchpad would be nice because it has support for double-buffering, but it does not even start for me
* midi-launchpad works, but is no longer maintained
* launchpadder works as well and is simple, but does not provide double-buffering

describing the MIDI interface of the Launchpad MK2 models.
